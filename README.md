# üöÇ Project Train Game (WanderTrains)
Welcome to train game, a fun and adventurous app that lets you explore the Netherlands by train. This app was created by Team Goofy, a group of four software engineering students from the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. We are passionate about coding and travelling, and we wanted to share our experience of playing the train game with others.

Below you will find more information about the train game. If you are interested in the technical details of our app, you can refer to the wiki section of our GitHub repository.

## üöâ What is the train game?
The train game is a simple but exciting way to discover new places by travelling by train. You start at any train station and let the app choose a random departure platform and exit station for you. You can take a picture of yourself in the city in which you have exited the train and save it to your profile. Then you repeat the process until you decide to end the game. The app will keep track of your trips, achievements and stats.

## üé´ Who can play the train game?
The train game is designed for anyone who has free or discounted public transport, such as students with student OV cards. It is also suitable for people who are curious about the Netherlands and want to see more of it. You can play the train game alone or with your friends.

## üó∫Ô∏è Why play the train game?
The train game is a unique and fun way to explore the Netherlands by train. You never know where you will end up, and you might discover places you have never heard of before. The train game also challenges you to be spontaneous and adventurous, and to enjoy the journey as much as the destination. The app also rewards you with achievements and stats based on your trips, to showcase to your friends!

## üïπÔ∏è How to play the train game?
To play the train game, you need to visit the website. You need to create an account and verify your email address. Then you can start a new game by pressing the start button on the homepage. The app will use your location to find the nearest station and choose a random departure platform and exit station for you. You need to exit the train at the exit station that is mentioned in the app. You can take a picture of yourself in the city in which you exited the train and save it to your profile. Then you can either continue the game by pressing the continue button or end the game by pressing the end button. The app will save your trip history on your profile page, where you can also see your achievements and stats.

## üìä Current State of the Project
This project was originally created as part of a school assignment by Team Goofy at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. The project is now complete and fully functional. As our MVP is now complete, we have stopped working on this project and will be continuing with a mobile version in the near future. Because of this, we are always open to feedback and suggestions for improvement. If you have any ideas or comments, please feel free to open an issue on our GitHub repository or contact us directly.

### üìà Future plans
For our mobile application project, we would like to improve and expand our application with the following features:
- Be able to connect with other travellers, by travelling together and sharing trips
- Add other modes of transport, such as bus, metro and tram
- City exploration option, where you can select a city and get a random route through it
- Sightseeing recommendations for each station
- More achievements and stats
